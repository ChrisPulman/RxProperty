# RxProperty

RxProperty provides MVVM and asynchronous support features under Reactive Extensions. Target frameworks are .net 6.0, .net 7.0, and .NET Standard 2.0.


RxProperty is very simple library.

RxProperty doesn't provide base class by ViewModel.
RxProperty can be used together other MVVM libraries like Prism, MVVMLight, etc...
